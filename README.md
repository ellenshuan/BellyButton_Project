# BellyButton_Project

## Oveview 
For this project, I used Javascript, HTML, and Plotly to create data visualizations on a website that shows the most common bacterial species existent in a sample of peple to create a study of bacterial species that potentially tastes like beef. This study is conducted for a Microbiology Labatory to study bacterial species to that can synthesize protens that taste like beef. This lab is partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup to research bacterial species in belly buttons searching for the illusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste.
